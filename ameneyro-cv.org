* Interests
My current research interests encompass the applications of artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning and quantum computing to biology, ecology and medicine. In the past I have worked with stochastic and ODE models for infectious diseases. My personal interests include the development of free and open source software as well as scientific outreach.
